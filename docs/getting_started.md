# Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to deploy Sentinel from a container image in either [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) or [minishift](https://www.okd.io/minishift/).

Alternatively, you can try and run the binary file directly whilst redirecting the output to the file system so that events can be seen being generated by Sentinel.

### Deploying from a container image

To deploy Sentinel to Kubernetes [see here](../scripts/kube/readme.md) or for OpenShift [see here](../scripts/openshift/readme.md).

### Trying out the binary file directly

If you want to try out the binary [see here](./binary_deploy.md).

## Changing the default configuration

The container image takes its default configuration from the [config.toml](../config.toml) file. In addition, if environment variables are passed in, they will override the configuration file variables.

So, in order to change the default configuration, either specify overriding [environment variables](configuration.md) or overlay a new configuration file using a [ConfigMap](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/configmaps.html#configmaps-creating-from-files).

## Webhook publishing

In order to publish to a web hook, update the Sentinel [configuration](configuration.md) to use the webhook publisher. Set the URI of the publisher to the address the web consumer application is listening to.

Start up a web consumer application where the web hook is pointing to, [such as the one here](../scripts/webhook/readme.md).

Run the sentinel process watching for events in a container platform.

Deploy an application on the container platform and see the changes appearing on the web consumer application terminal.

## Kafka publishing

In order to publish to Kafka, update the Sentinel [configuration](configuration.md) to use the broker publisher. Set the Brokers list of the publisher to a comma separated list of one or more addresses the message broker is listening to.

Start up a Kafka message broker. See [here](../scripts/kafka/readme.md) for information on how to set up a development instance.

Run the sentinel process watching for events in a container platform.

Deploy an application and see the changes appearing on the web consumer application terminal.
